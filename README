This is the README file of CSE156/L Final Project assignment, written by Jingheng Wang (jwang280@ucsc.edu, NUMBER ID 1591816).

Description of the assignment:
The objective of this assignment is to create a TCP-based chat program composed of a client for the end users and a server program which will be used to connect clients so that they can exchange messages.

To build the executable file:
Run gmake in the main directory (i.e. parent directory of where the current file is). The main directory should contain three folders, doc, bin, src, and a file "Makefile".

The sources are in the /src folder.
The executable file build by gmake is in the /bin folder.
